# SULI2020_CrabCrossingAnimation
These animations were made using the python libraries matplotlib to generate the frames in Jupyter notebook. Then using Ffmpeg the frames were compiled into a gif.

The EIC uses an ion beam and an electron beam in order to probe hadrons. By creating oscillations in the beams in a process called “crabbing,” the luminosity of the collider can be increased. The luminosity is proportional to the number of collisions in an amount of time. Increasing the luminosity is a high priority, because it gives more opportunities to collect data on rare processes in the collider.
